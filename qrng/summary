Quantum Random Number Generator
The QRNG is designed to be flexible in the number of qubits and number of outcomes. In this project I have done few basic exercise regarding quantum random number for 1,2,3,4 and n qubits. Firstly, I applied Hadamard gates to create superposition then measure qubits to get binary string. After that I converted binary to decimal numbers. 
For 1-qubits it generates 0 and 1. The probability for both of them is 50%.
For 2-qubits it generates random 0,1,2,3. The probability for each is 25%.
For 3-qubits it generates random 0 to 7 where the probability is 12.5% for each.
For 4-qubits it generates from 0-15 but we use 0-9 as per given task with rejection sampling.
Similarly, for n gates
Here, each number has equal probability i.e  ½^n  .
Qiskit's Aer simulator is used where measurements are taken from a quantum register to classical bits, and then this binary string is converted into an integer.
